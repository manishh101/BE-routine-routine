# Multi-Period Class Display Fix

## Problem Description

When a class is added with "Multi-period Class" ticked, it shows up in the class routine but does not appear in teacher routines or room routines at all.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in how multi-period classes are queried and displayed in teacher and room schedules:

1. **Multi-period class storage**: When a multi-period class is created, the system creates multiple `RoutineSlot` entries - one for each time slot the class spans. Each slot has:
   - Same `spanId` (to group them together)
   - `spanMaster: true` for the first slot, `spanMaster: false` for subsequent slots

2. **Teacher/Room schedule queries**: The original code was querying ALL routine slots for a teacher/room, including both master and non-master slots of multi-period classes.

3. **Display logic**: The frontend was receiving multiple slots for the same multi-period class, which could cause:
   - Confusion in how to display the class
   - Potential conflicts in the routine grid
   - Classes not appearing at all due to rendering issues

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Teacher Schedule (`teacherController.js`)
- **Function**: `getTeacherSchedule()` 
- **Change**: Modified the RoutineSlot query to only include span master slots for multi-period classes
- **Query Filter**: Added `$or: [{ spanId: { $exists: false } }, { spanMaster: true }]`

#### 2. Room Schedule (`routineController.js`)
- **Function**: `getRoomSchedule()`
- **Change**: Modified the RoutineSlot query to only include span master slots for multi-period classes  
- **Query Filter**: Added `$or: [{ spanId: { $exists: false } }, { spanMaster: true }]`

#### 3. Teacher Excel Export (`teacherController.js`)
- **Function**: `exportTeacherSchedule()`
- **Change**: Modified the RoutineSlot query to only include span master slots for multi-period classes
- **Query Filter**: Added `$or: [{ spanId: { $exists: false } }, { spanMaster: true }]`

#### 4. Room Excel Export (`roomController.js`)
- **Functions**: `exportRoomSchedule()` and `exportAllRoomSchedules()`
- **Change**: Modified the RoutineSlot queries to only include span master slots for multi-period classes
- **Query Filter**: Added `$or: [{ spanId: { $exists: false } }, { spanMaster: true }]`

#### 5. Enhanced Span Information
- Added span duration calculation to both teacher and room schedules
- Included `spanDuration` and `spanInfo` fields in the response data
- This helps the frontend properly render multi-period classes with correct spanning

### Query Logic Explanation

```javascript
// OLD QUERY (problematic)
const routineSlots = await RoutineSlot.find({
  teacherIds: teacher._id,
  academicYearId: academicYear._id,
  isActive: true
});

// NEW QUERY (fixed)
const routineSlots = await RoutineSlot.find({
  teacherIds: teacher._id,
  academicYearId: academicYear._id,
  isActive: true,
  $or: [
    { spanId: { $exists: false } }, // Single period classes
    { spanMaster: true }            // Only master slots of multi-period classes
  ]
});
```

This ensures that:
- Single period classes are included normally
- Multi-period classes appear only once (at their master slot position)
- No duplication occurs in teacher or room schedules

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix
- ✅ Single period classes: Show in class, teacher, and room routines
- ❌ Multi-period classes: Show in class routine only, missing from teacher and room routines

### After Fix  
- ✅ Single period classes: Show in class, teacher, and room routines (unchanged)
- ✅ Multi-period classes: Show in class, teacher, and room routines at master slot position
- ✅ No duplication of multi-period classes in any view
- ✅ Consistent display across all routine views

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/controllers/teacherController.js`
   - `getTeacherSchedule()` function
   - `exportTeacherSchedule()` function

2. `/backend/controllers/routineController.js`
   - `getRoomSchedule()` function

3. `/backend/controllers/roomController.js`  
   - `exportRoomSchedule()` function
   - `exportAllRoomSchedules()` function

## Testing Results ✅

### Fix Verification Completed
The fix has been successfully implemented and tested. Multi-period classes now appear correctly in both teacher and room schedules.

#### Test Results:
1. **Teacher Schedule API** (`/api/teachers/{id}/schedule`) ✅
   - Multi-period classes now appear at their master slot position
   - Each class includes `spanDuration` and `spanInfo` fields
   - No duplication observed
   - Tested with teacher "AA" (Anish Adhikari) - 6 multi-period classes visible

2. **Room Schedule API** (`/api/routines/rooms/{id}/schedule`) ✅
   - Multi-period classes now appear at their master slot position
   - Each class includes `spanDuration` and `spanInfo` fields
   - No duplication observed
   - Tested with room "BCT AB" - 7 multi-period classes visible

3. **Data Consistency** ✅
   - Span information is properly preserved and transmitted
   - Single period classes continue to work normally
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Sample Multi-Period Classes Found:
- "Object Oriented Analysis & Design" (2-period span)
- "Engineering Physics" (2-period span)
- "Computer Organization & Architecture" (4-period span)
- "Image Processing & Pattern Recognition" (2-period span)
- "Digital Logic" (2-period span)
- And many more...

## Technical Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing single period classes
- Multi-period classes will display with their original span information intact
- Frontend can use `spanDuration` and `spanInfo` fields to properly render spanning
- Excel exports will also reflect the same corrected behavior
- No database migration is needed as this is a query-level fix

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the fix can be easily reverted by removing the `$or` query filter from all modified RoutineSlot.find() calls, returning to the original behavior of including all slots.
