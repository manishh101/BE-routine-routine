# MeetingSchedulerGrid Frontend Enhancement

## Overview
The `MeetingSchedulerGrid` component has been updated to utilize the enhanced `/api/teachers/meeting-scheduler` API response that includes detailed teacher unavailability information.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Grid Data Structure
- **Before**: Used complex logic to calculate busy teachers from available slots
- **After**: Directly uses the `busySlots` data from the enhanced API response
- **New Field**: `busySlotData` - stores complete busy slot information including teacher commitments

### 2. Improved Unavailable Slot Display
Red (unavailable) slots now show:
- **Teacher Short Names**: Displayed as styled badges in the cell
- **Conflict Severity**: "Full Conflict" or "Partial Conflict" indicator
- **Enhanced Styling**: Teacher names shown in bordered badges for better visibility

### 3. Enhanced Tooltips
Tooltips for unavailable slots now provide:
- **Busy Teacher Count**: "X/Y teachers busy"
- **Detailed Reasons**: Each teacher's specific unavailability reason
- **Available Teachers**: List of teachers who are still available (for partial conflicts)

### 4. Visual Improvements
- Teacher names displayed in styled badges with red borders
- Conflict severity indicators
- Better color coding for different conflict types
- Updated legend to indicate teacher codes are shown

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```javascript
// Enhanced API Response Structure Used:
searchResults.busySlots.forEach(busySlot => {
  // busySlot contains:
  // - busyTeachers: Array with teacher details and unavailability reasons
  // - availableTeachers: Array of still available teachers
  // - conflictSeverity: 'high' or 'partial'
  // - totalTeachersRequested, busyTeachersCount, etc.
});
```

### Grid Data Structure
```javascript
grid[dayIndex][timeSlotId] = {
  available: false,
  slot: null,
  busyTeachers: ['JS', 'MD', 'PK'], // Teacher short names
  busySlotData: {
    busyTeachers: [...], // Full teacher objects with reasons
    conflictSeverity: 'high',
    availableTeachers: [...],
    // ... other enhanced data
  }
}
```

### Cell Rendering
- **Available Slots**: Green background, no content
- **Unavailable Slots**: 
  - Red background
  - Teacher short names in styled badges
  - Conflict severity indicator
  - Enhanced tooltip with detailed information

## Benefits

### 1. Better User Experience
- Users can immediately see which teachers are causing conflicts
- Detailed tooltips provide context for scheduling decisions
- Visual distinction between full and partial conflicts

### 2. Improved Decision Making
- Quick identification of problematic teachers
- Understanding of conflict severity helps prioritize slot selection
- Available teachers shown for partial conflicts suggest alternatives

### 3. Enhanced Visual Design
- Cleaner, more professional appearance
- Better information density without clutter
- Responsive design maintains readability

## Example Display

### Unavailable Slot Cell:
```
┌─────────────────┐
│      [JS]       │  <- Teacher short name in styled badge
│      [MD]       │  <- Another busy teacher
│ Partial Conflict│  <- Conflict severity indicator
└─────────────────┘
```

### Enhanced Tooltip:
```
Unavailable - 2/3 teachers busy

JS: Teaching DBMS501 (BCT-5-A)
MD: Teaching MATH301 (BEI-3-B)

Available: PK
```

## Dependencies Optimization
- Removed unnecessary dependencies on `selectedTeachers` and `allTeachers` from useMemo
- Simplified grid calculation logic
- Improved performance by using direct API data instead of complex calculations

## Backward Compatibility
- Component interface remains unchanged
- Falls back gracefully if enhanced API data is not available
- Existing functionality preserved for basic unavailability display

## Testing
Test the enhanced display by:
1. Creating meeting scheduler searches with conflicting teachers
2. Verifying teacher short names appear in unavailable slots
3. Checking tooltip content shows detailed unavailability reasons
4. Confirming conflict severity indicators display correctly
5. Validating partial conflicts show available teachers in tooltips
