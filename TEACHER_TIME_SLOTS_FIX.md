# Teache## Solution
### Backend Changes
1. **Updated `timeSlotController.js`** - Added support for `includeAll` parameter:
   - When `includeAll=true`, the API fetches all time slots regardless of context
   - This includes both global time slots and context-specific time slots from all programs/semesters/sections

### Frontend Changes
2. **Updated `RoutineGrid.jsx`** - Modified time slot fetching logic:
   - For `teacherViewMode` and `roomViewMode`: Uses `includeAll=true` and `includeGlobal=true` to fetch all time slots
   - For class routine view: Uses specific context parameters (`programCode`, `semester`, `section`) with `includeGlobal=true`
   - **Added deduplication logic**: Removes duplicate time slots with the same time range when using `includeAll=true`
   - **Added smart filtering**: For teacher/room views, only shows context-specific time slots that have actual classes assigned throughout the week

3. **Updated Teacher-Related Components**:
   - `TeacherScheduleManager.jsx` - Uses `includeAll=true` for comprehensive schedule management
   - `pages/admin/Teachers.jsx` - Uses `includeAll=true` for admin panel display
   - **Meeting Schedulers** - Use only global time slots (`includeGlobal=true` only):
     - `TeacherMeetingScheduler.jsx` - Fixed to use only global time slots
     - `TeacherMeetingSchedulerNew.jsx` - Fixed to use only global time slotsext-Specific Time Slots Fix

## Problem
In the teacher routine view, context-specific time slots (classes) were not showing. The teacher view was only displaying global time slots, missing context-specific time slots that might exist for specific programs/semesters/sections.

## Root Cause
The time slot fetching logic in `RoutineGrid.jsx` was using the same query parameters for both class routine view and teacher view. For teacher view, we need to fetch ALL time slots (both global and context-specific across all contexts) because teachers might teach multiple classes across different programs/semesters/sections.

   - When `includeAll=true`, the API fetches all time slots regardless of context
   - This includes both global time slots and context-specific time slots from all programs/semesters/sections

   - For class routine view: Uses specific context parameters (`programCode`, `semester`, `section`) with `includeGlobal=true`

3. **Updated Teacher-Related Components** - Applied the same fix to all teacher-related components:
   - `TeacherScheduleManager.jsx`
   - `TeacherMeetingScheduler.jsx` 
   - `TeacherMeetingSchedulerNew.jsx`
   - `pages/admin/Teachers.jsx`

## Files Modified
```
backend/controllers/timeSlotController.js
frontend/src/components/RoutineGrid.jsx (includes deduplication fix)
frontend/src/components/TeacherScheduleManager.jsx (includes all contexts)
frontend/src/pages/admin/Teachers.jsx (includes all contexts)
frontend/src/pages/TeacherMeetingScheduler.jsx (global slots only)
frontend/src/pages/TeacherMeetingSchedulerNew.jsx (global slots only)
```

## API Changes
### New Query Parameter
- `includeAll=true` - Fetches all time slots (both global and context-specific)

### Query Examples
- **Class routine**: `GET /api/time-slots?programCode=BCT&semester=5&section=CD&includeGlobal=true`
- **Teacher view**: `GET /api/time-slots?includeAll=true&includeGlobal=true`

## Testing
Use the provided test script to verify the fix:
```bash
node test-time-slots-fix.js
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Class Routine View**: Shows global + context-specific time slots for that specific program/semester/section
2. **Teacher Routine View**: 
   - Shows ALL available time slots (global + context-specific from all programs/semesters/sections)
   - Deduplicates time slots with identical time ranges (no more double 5:00-7:00 columns)
   - Only displays context-specific time slots that actually have classes assigned
3. **Room Routine View**:
   - Shows ALL available time slots (global + context-specific from all programs/semesters/sections) 
   - Deduplicates time slots with identical time ranges
   - Only displays context-specific time slots that actually have classes assigned
4. **Meeting Schedulers**: Use only global time slots for general meeting scheduling
5. **Admin Components**: Display complete time slot coverage across all contexts

## Benefits
- Teachers can now see all possible time slots where they might have classes
- Complete visibility of context-specific time slots in teacher views, but only when they're actually used
- Consistent time slot handling across all teacher-related components
- Better meeting scheduling with appropriate time slot coverage
- Cleaner grids without empty context-specific time slot columns
- No duplicate time columns for the same time range
